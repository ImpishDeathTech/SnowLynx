-- .snowrc
--
-- this is the configuration file for snowlynx, you can do anything here, it is loaded at the beginning of the program
-- add any custom commands and modes here. everything is written in lua. You could also write these in the snowtab, but
-- that is not my convention. .snowtab is for snowtabs, .snowrc is for commands and modes
-- mode should be done as
--
-- commands should be written as
--
-- function snow.commandname(snowtab)
--      code
-- end
--
-- modes should be written as
--
-- function snow.Tab:modename()
--      code
-- end
--


function snow.Tab:custom()
    return snow[self.compiler](self.order())
end

snow.opt = 'custom'
